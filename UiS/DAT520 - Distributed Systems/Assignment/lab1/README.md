## Introduction

This first lab will give you an overview of the lab project as a whole.

## Lab Overview

The lab project for this course consist of six assignments (the list may change
during the semester):

1. Getting Started
2. Network Programming in Go
3. Failure Detector and Leader Election
4. Single-Decree Paxos and Multi-Paxos
5. Multi-Paxos with Gorums and Performance Evaluation
6. Bank Application with Reconfiguration

The first two assignments are introductory and individual. They are intended to
setup the working environment for the lab submissions and get you up to speed on the Go programming language and basic network programming. The remaining assignments form the main lab project and should be done in groups.

The aim of the overall lab project is to implement a fault tolerant
application, replicated on several machines, using the Paxos protocol. The
Paxos protocol will be introduced in the course accordingly. For this we will
use the Go programming language. Go is very well suited to implement the
event-driven structure of the Paxos protocol. You will for each lab construct
an independent part of the application, resulting in a complete implementation
in Lab 6.

## Getting Started

Enough said, let's get started!
The first lab is composed by two parts:

1. [Setup](setup/README.md) - Setting up the working environment and tools required by all labs.
2. [Go](gointro/README.md) - Basic programming tasks to get you familiar with the Go programming language.
